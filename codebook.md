##Data description / experimental study design
The data contains accelerometer/ gyroscope data of 30 volunteers who are perfoming six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) that has been collected from the smartphone they are wearing (Samsung Galaxy S2).

The subject_test/ subject_train dataset contains information identifying the volunteer #. The X-train/test dataset contains the variables that were recorded such as acceleartion, velocity, etc.. The y-train/test dataset contains the activity type (e.g. SITTING, WALKING, etc.).

##Data summary choices
The average of the 30 test subjects' mean and standard deviation of the data was summarized as it provides an idea of the expected magnitude of variables between individuals. The individuals own mean contains data about their own habits, taking the average of that means that we are looking at the groups average "habits".
